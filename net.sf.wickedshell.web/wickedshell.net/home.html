		<span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span> is an Eclipse plugin providing direct access to your system's shell.
		To be honest, <span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span> is not evil at all, although it calls itself wicked...

	<p class=content>
		<span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span> is a small plugin trying to support your daily work with the Eclipse IDE.
		Although it is called <span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span>, it's not a real shell itself. 
		<span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span> is an eclipse plugin which functions as mediator between a Runtime process 
		and a SWT Text widget. That means the output of the Runtime process is transferred to the widget and the text typed 
		in the widget is transferred to the process as input. So Wicked Shell is not an actual shell but only uses an existing 
		shell implementation.
	</p>
	
	<p class=content>
		I always try to improve this plugin by ideas of my own. But I have to admit, although <span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span>
		only exist for not even one year, a lot of feature are implemented due to requests by the community. So feel free to
		submit any feature request that makes <span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span> more suitable for you. It won't be
		implemented immediately, but soon!
	</p>

		If you have any questions concerning the <span class=emphasizer>Wicked Shell</span> please let me know. Have fun!
