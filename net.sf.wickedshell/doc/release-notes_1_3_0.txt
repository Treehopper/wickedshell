** WickedShell - Release 1.3.0 **
**        Release-Notes        **
*********************************

This is release 1.3.0 of WickedShell. 

It contains the following enhancements:

    - Improved input handling
    - Support for Cygwin bash.exe added
        It is recommended to modify the PS1 prompting enviromental value 
        to avoid any character output of the prompt (such as ASCII escape 
        characters) that cannot be displayed by SWT's Text widget. 
        Otherwise it looks funny...
        To do so, just define the PS1 value in the '.bashrc' file of your
        home directory (PS1=\\t' '\\u'@'\\H\\r\\n\\w'$ ' as a suggestion).
        Please pay attention, that your prompt ends with '$ ', as Wicked 
        Shell uses this for path delimiting.
        To make command completion work, the last line of the prompt must
        consist of the current path and the suffix '$ ' (see above).
    - Support for MSYS sh.exe added
        It is recommended to modify the PS1 prompting enviromental value 
        to avoid any character output of the prompt (such as ASCII escape 
        characters) that cannot be displayed by SWT's Text widget. 
        Otherwise it looks funny...
        To do so, just define the PS1 value in the 'profile' file of the
        etc directory (PS1=\\t' '\\u'@'\\H\\r\\n\\w'$ ' as a suggestion).
        Please pay attention, that your prompt ends with '$ ', as Wicked 
        Shell uses this for path delimiting.
        To make command completion work, the last line of the prompt must
        consist of the current path and the suffix '$ ' (see above).
